## Competition Description
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

This challenge ask us to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.

### Goal
The goal is to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. 
For each PassengerId in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the Survived variable.

### Metric
Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known simply as "accuracy”.

## Data
The data has been split into two groups:
- training set (train.csv)
- test set (test.csv)

The **training set** provides the outcome for each passenger. The model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. 

The **test set** is used to see how well the model performs on unseen data. For the test set, they do not provide the outcome for each passenger.
